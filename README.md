- 👋 Hi, I am Kafo
- 👀 I am interested in becoming a FullStack-Developer. I have come from a non-tech background and have no knowledge what are the tech industry requirements.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the basic of being a Fullstack-Developer. While currently studying at MissionReadyHq in an Advanced Software Developer course, I became more passion about coding and learning new technologies that I have not expericence through my journey.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone who is willing to learn and has expericence in the fundamental of being a Developer.
- 📫 You can reach me through this email: kafolautila@gmail.com
